## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### How does it work?
The EOS wallet is currently running an airdrop to promote network activity and liquidity. Sending EOS to your account's unique destination tag (memo) results in the EOS being returned in a multiplied amount.

### What is my destination tag?
Log into your Coinbase EOS wallet. Click **Receive** to view your memo. This memo acts as your destination tag.

### Why would EOS do this?
To incentivize usage and increase on-chain volume and liquidity in the EOS ecosystem.
